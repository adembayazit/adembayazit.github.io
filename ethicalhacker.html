  <h1>An ethical hacker is someone who works within legal and ethical boundaries to test and defend the security of computer systems.</h1>

  <h2>They idenftify vulnerabilities in systems and report them to help fix security gaps.Their main goal is to provide protection against malicious attacks by cybercriminals.</h2>


  <p>
    
    Ethical hackers, also known as white-hat hackers, are individuals who utilize their skills to identify vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, and software applications. They employ the same techniques and tools as malicious hackers, but with the explicit permission of the system owners or stakeholders. By conducting controlled penetration testing and vulnerability assessments, ethical hackers aim to uncover weaknesses that could potentially be exploited by cyber attackers.

Once vulnerabilities are identified, ethical hackers provide detailed reports to the system administrators or developers, outlining the discovered weaknesses and recommending remediation measures to mitigate the risks. This proactive approach helps organizations enhance their cybersecurity posture and protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other cyber threats.

Ethical hacking plays a crucial role in cybersecurity as it enables organizations to proactively identify and address security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors. By employing ethical hackers, companies can strengthen their defense mechanisms, improve incident response capabilities, and ultimately safeguard their digital assets and infrastructure from cyber attacks.
